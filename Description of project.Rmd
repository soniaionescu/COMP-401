# Creation of R package
## Photo digitization
##### File name:
digitizeLandmarks.R

##### Purpose:
To go from photos of fish to an excel sheet with coordinates of landmarks, which can then be used for future steps in analysis.

##### Input:
An excel sheet of file names of photos. This should be in the same folder as the photos themselves, which should be set to the working directory, using setwd(), or, if working in R Studio (recommended), Session > Set Working Directory > Choose directory.

##### Output:
An excel file with x and y coordinates of all 39 landmarks on the fish, labeled. This is saved over each time the function is run, so copy and paste the output into another file/safe space before running it again.

##### Functions:

###### Packages required before running this:
jpeg
dplyr

###### plot_jpeg:
Plots a jpeg in the "plot" window in R Studio.

###### digitize_landmark
Takes the output of plot_jpeg and uses the locator function to have the user plot 39 points on the fish. Then has the user choose two points an inch apart, and uses this to scale the measurements from pixels to inches. Then, runs normalize_coordinates on these coordinates. Then, writes these coordinates into a csv.

## Creating a morphospace

##### File Name:
create_morphospace.R

##### Purpose:
Create a relative warp analysis/principle component analysis for a specific community.

##### Input:
An excel file with all of the members of a community. 

##### Output:
A list containing a PCA object which has the (x, y) coordinates associated with the PCA graph, as well as a list of species.

##### Functions:

###### Packages required before running this:
Alphahull
ggplot and ggfortify
rgl, which requires a download of XQuartz on mac

###### species_average
Creates an "average" fish of the species, which have already been analyzed using GPA in the function overall_average; this outputs an array of each average fish.

###### overall_average
Generate a consensus morphology that averages the position of each landmark across all species; this is done based off the 

###### relative_warp
Run Principal Component analysis comparing each species of the community, and plot PC1 and PC2.

## Morphospace analysis

##### File Name:
morphospace_analysis.R

##### Purpose:
To analyse the density of a morphospace.

##### Input:
A morphospace (the PCA object which is the output of relative_warp).

##### Output:
A morphospace which has been analyzed for density, or which has had Voronoi polygons added.

##### Functions:

###### Packages required before running this:
kde2d
ggplot2
deldir

###### continuous_kerneldensity
Apply 2D kernel density onto a morphospace to reflect the density of the space.

###### contour_kerneldensity
Apply 2D kernel density onto a morphospace to reflect the density of the space.

###### mountain_graph
Show the kernel density in a 3D manner.

###### Voronoi_polygon
Add Voronoi polygons to the morphospace, to represent avaiable niche space for every species within the community.
